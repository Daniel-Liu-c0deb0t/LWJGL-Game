# LWJGL-Game
Simple Java game using LWJGL for drawing.

The game is not finished, and probably will never be finished. This is an example of using low level OpenGL commands to draw (through the LWJGL library). So in order to run this program, make sure the LWJGL library is part of the build configurations.
